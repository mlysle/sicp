# CS61A & SICP

This file contains my solutions to problems from UC Berkeley's CS61A. I have also gone ahead and solve many unassigned problems from the textbook, **[Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)**. I started working on this course in late 2022/early 2023 before taking a break to focus on my formal education. I am now returning to finish what I started.

## Structure

- `/SICP` contains solutions to the SICP textbook problems organized by section.
- `/CS61A` contains solutions to the CS61A course problems. Problems taken from the textbook are linked to `/SICP` by symlink (still thinking of a better way to organize this).
